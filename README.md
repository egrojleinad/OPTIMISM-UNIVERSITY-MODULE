# OPTIMISM-UNIVERSITY-MODULE
This project is being made in collaboration with CENFOTEC Costa Rica University.

***Project Summary***

This grant proposal seeks to introduce Optimism governance concepts to Costa Rican universities, starting with (CENFOTEC). We aim to create a replicable model for future iterations, fostering a self-sustaining educational program within the university.

**Team and Collaborators**

The project is led by a dedicated team of educators:
Ignacio Trejos Zelaya (Project Lead)
Álvaro Cordero Peña (Director, School of Software Engineering)
Miguel Pérez Montero (Director, School of Cybersecurity)

We have secured the invaluable support from Alberto Galan (from inbest program) and from the Costa Rican Ethereum community (EthereumCR) Additionally, recognized blockchain community members like Andres Guzman from ETH Foundation, Daniel Bejarano web3 full time dev will contribute to specific more advanced modules.

**Project Goals and Strategy**

**CRITICAL Goal:** Successful Completion of First Edition
Graduate 25 students with a comprehensive understanding of Optimism governance.
Document and promote the program through various channels (Optimism forum, university channels, local newspapers).
Gather feedback for syllabus improvement.

**Goal 2:** Building a Sustainable Model
Achieve self-sufficiency within the university by the second edition.
Generate a whitelist of 100 students interested in future iterations.
Implementation Plan

**Curriculum and Assessments:** A well-defined syllabus outlines the program structure, including quizzes, exams, and a final project. Completion of all elements is mandatory for receiving the OP token rewards (100 OP per graduate student).

**Student Data Collection:** Secure data collection procedures will gather student wallet addresses, contract creation hashes, and attestation records. Three attestations will be conducted throughout the course (once per module). Educators will also provide modular attestations for students.

**Token Distribution:**

**Graduates:** Successful completion of the program grants 100 OP tokens per student (total 2500 OP).
**Educators:** Participating educators receive 333 OP tokens each (total 1000 OP) upon completion of the program.
Distribution occurs from a newly created multisig wallet, ensuring transparency and security.

**Sustainability and Scalability**
This project serves as a stepping stone for long-term university-driven education in Optimism governance. The focus on documentation, feedback collection, and a whitelist system lays the groundwork for future independent program iterations.

**Budget Breakdown**
Requested Grant Amount: 3500 OP tokens
Token Allocation:
Student Rewards: 2500 OP (100 OP/student)
Educator Incentives: 1000 OP (333 OP/educator)


**Project Timeline**
The syllabus (linked below) details the weekly program schedule, including specific dates for each session.

**Impact and Proof of Progress**
We will actively document and promote the program's progress through various channels:
Optimism Forum
University channels
Local newspapers
Instructor and student testimonials
Documentation of third-party support
